### **DAY-2 GOOD FLOORPLAN VS BAD FLOOR PLAN AND INTRODUCTION TO LIBRARY CELLS**</p>

` Dk2_Sk1-Chip floor planning considerations` </p>

- The session says about the height and the width of the core and die</p>
- The initial step in the physical design process involves determining the width and height of the layout. Let's start with a netlist that includes two flip-flops and a simple combinational logic circuit between them. A netlist represents the connectivity of an electronic design. Here, we're focusing on the dimensions of the logic gates (AND & OR) and the specific flip-flops. Our goal is to convert these symbols into physical dimensions, with an emphasis on the dimensions of the Core and Die, rather than the wiring.</p>

![Screenshot 2024-08-10 114934](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbb1ee84-aa25-4953-aabd-683886133d5b)
![Screenshot 2024-08-10 114946](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d98c509b-7de8-429d-b93e-76c9803b60fe)</p>
From the above diagram</p>
let us consider standard cell that has the dimensions of 1unit * 1unit</p>
so area = 1sq units</p>
![Screenshot 2024-08-10 115125](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41b9187d-7587-4b85-b380-5e973ac0d384)
![Screenshot 2024-08-10 115312](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe64320a-6319-4520-9e46-5f0f1d565b19)</p>
 utilization factor = 1
(1 means core is fully utilized  the area and no space left)

Aspect Ratio = Height / width = 2 unit / 2unit = 1

Aspect Ratio is 1 it signifies that chip is square shaped. When it is not 1 it means the chip is in rectangular shape.

![Screenshot 2024-08-10 120207](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfcc9ac7-8b8a-4327-9cad-9bfb6b47bf77)</p>
The image shows the process of defining the locations of preplaced cells in a physical design layout. It begins with a combinational logic design, which is then broken down into specific components like logic gates and flip-flops. The circuit is divided into two parts (cut1 and cut2) and further grouped into two blocks, "Block 1" and "Block 2". Each block contains a specific set of cells, which are preplaced in defined locations to optimize the layout for performance, power, and area requirements.</p>
![Screenshot 2024-08-10 120249](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33c15cbd-34ff-4f37-b6b3-5d8001ef4381)
![Screenshot 2024-08-10 120312](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf13f099-d3c3-4c57-9b9d-a6005057ec17)
![Screenshot 2024-08-10 120322](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad4fe523-a904-4c00-a8b7-2b2346870efb)</p>
In both blocks, we extend the input-output pins and then black box them, making the internal design invisible to those viewing the main netlist. By separating them as distinct IPs or modules, we enable reuse of these blocks after a single implementation. This approach is similar to other IPs like Memory, Clock-gating cells, Comparators, and MUXes, which are part of the top-level netlist. These IPs receive signals, perform specific functions, and deliver outputs, but their functionality is implemented only once.</p>
![Screenshot 2024-08-10 120635](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89fb7b3d-ec9a-4998-b6ae-65304a77e0ab)</p>

The arrangement of IPs on a chip is called floorplanning. Pre-placed cells, which have user-defined locations, are positioned so that automated tools donâ€™t change their placement. In circuits, de-coupling capacitors manage switching currents when gates change states, ensuring proper voltage levels. However, the presence of resistance and inductance can cause a voltage drop, leading to a reduced voltage at certain nodes during switching.</p>

![Screenshot 2024-08-10 121146](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb562266-8b71-40a7-9297-dacab3c20cff)

![Screenshot 2024-08-10 122530](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f1d48e0-b86f-47ba-8381-f4cf004ebc89)
![Screenshot 2024-08-10 122845](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c44f264e-4186-4423-8286-b2d646171473)</p>
In the chip layout, decoupling capacitors are placed between Block A, Block B, and Block C to ensure that power is properly supplied by these capacitors. This setup handles local communication effectively. 

**Power Planning:**
Consider the local circuitry as a black box that can be repeated multiple times, with logic at the boundaries. The current demand issue is addressed by decoupling capacitors. Signals sent from a driver to a load, such as a logic 0 to logic 1 transition, need to be maintained consistently, requiring sufficient power from the supply. For a 16-bit bus, however, placing decoupling capacitors along the entire path isnâ€™t feasible, leading to potential voltage drops due to the distance from the power supply.

When the bus signals transition, capacitors charged to Vdd (logic 1) or discharged to ground (logic 0) will switch states. If the bus is connected to an inverter, all initially charged capacitors will discharge and vice-versa. The issue arises because all capacitors share a single ground connection, causing a spike, known as **Ground Bounce**, during discharge. If this spike exceeds the noise margin, it could push the signal into an undefined state, leading to unpredictable logic levels.

Similarly, when capacitors charged to 0 volts need to be charged to V volts, they draw current through a single Vdd connection, potentially lowering the voltage at the Vdd tap point. If this voltage drop stays within the noise margin, the circuit remains stable, but if it enters an undefined region, the behavior becomes unpredictable. This problem occurs because power is supplied from only one point.

**Solution:**
To address this issue, multiple power supplies should be used, creating a mesh network. Each block would draw power from the nearest supply and similarly discharge to the closest ground. This mesh power supply design helps maintain consistent power levels across the chip, preventing issues like Ground Bounce and voltage drops.

So the LAYOUT will be like:</p>

The connectivity information between the gates is coded using VHDL/Verilog language and is called as 'Netlist'.</p>

In OpenLANE, FP_PDN files are used to configure the power distribution network, and these switches are set by default during the floorplan stage. The FP_IO MODE setting (1, 0) indicates that pin positioning is random but equally spaced.

In terms of priority, OpenLANE first considers the system default settings in `floorplanning.tcl`, followed by the settings in `config.tcl`, and finally, the settings in the PDK variant file (`sky130A_sky130_fd_sc_hd_config.tcl`).

### Die Area Calculation
```bash
**Given:**
- Unit distance: 1 micron
- Die width in unit distance: 660,685
- Die height in unit distance: 671,405

**Conversions:**
- Die width in microns = \( \frac{660,685}{1000} = 660.685 \) microns
- Die height in microns = \( \frac{671,405}{10,000} = 671.405 \) microns

**Area Calculation:**
- Area of the die in microns = \( 660.685 \times 671.405 = 443,587.212425 \) square microns

` D2_Sk2-LIBRARY BINDING AND PLACEMENT `</p>

Binding a netlist with physical cells is a critical step in the process of designing and implementing integrated circuits (ICs). This step involves mapping the logical components of your design, represented by the netlist, to the actual physical cells in a standard cell library, which are used during the layout phase of IC design. Hereâ€™s an overview of how this process typically works:</p>
1. Netlist Creation:</p>
The netlist is generated from a high-level design, typically written in a hardware description language (HDL) like Verilog or VHDL. The netlist describes the circuit's components (like gates, flip-flops, etc.) and the connections between them.</p>
2. Standard Cell Library:</p>
A standard cell library contains pre-designed and pre-characterized physical representations of various logic gates and other components. Each cell in the library corresponds to a specific logic function, such as NAND, NOR, D flip-flop, etc., and comes with details like area, power consumption, and delay characteristics.</p>

![f13](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0657c463-6aa5-4ac3-879c-c1817fa0344f)

A Library in the context of integrated circuit (IC) design refers to a collection of pre-designed, pre-characterized components (cells) that are used during various stages of the design process. These libraries are essential for translating a digital design from its high-level representation (e.g., Verilog or VHDL code) to a physical implementation on silicon.Library divides into 2 sublibraries. First may consists of size and shape  and other consists of the delay information.</p>

**PLACEMENT :**</p>

Once the netlist is bound to physical cells, the placement tool arranges these cells on the IC layout. This step considers the physical constraints and aims to optimize the placement for minimal delay, power, and area usage.</p>

Consider the circuit diagram</p> 
![f14](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05a75725-cf73-46af-856f-f0b64b735edd)</p>
Signal integrity: </p>
Signal integrity in PCB (Printed Circuit Board) placement refers to maintaining the quality and fidelity of electrical signals as they travel through a circuit. Good signal integrity ensures that the signals are not distorted, delayed, or lost due to the layout and placement of components on the board. Poor signal integrity can lead to errors, malfunction, and degraded performance of electronic devices.</p>

Optimize placement:</p>
Optimizing  placement plays a crucial for ensuring signal integrity, minimizing delays, and improving overall performance. The key goal is to reduce the length of critical signal paths and manage capacitance to minimize unwanted effects like signal degradation, noise, and power loss.</p> 
We add `repeaters`(buffers) inorder to create a new singal between the input and the output such that the data is encrypted correctly and the information is not loss.</p>
Consider the placement of the ff-1:</p>
We donot add any buffers as the data can be accessible easily.</p>
![f15](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/702b03a7-92f7-4fd1-884c-a3c2404bc3f2)</p>

Now let us consider the ff-2:</p>
The signal path for `Din2` starts at its input, where it first passes through a buffer to strengthen the signal. It then reaches Flip-Flop 1 (FF1) and continues through additional buffers and logic components labeled "1" and "2." Finally, the signal arrives at Flip-Flop 2 (FF2) and is connected to `Dout2`. Buffers are strategically placed along the path to ensure the signal remains strong and stable, optimizing signal integrity throughout the route.</p>
![f16](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3f7d8ae-d433-4f29-92be-ccf61c31ac20) </p>

consider ff-3:</p>
The signal path for `Din3` begins at its input on the left side of the PCB layout. It first reaches Flip-Flop 1 (FF1), then passes through a buffer to strengthen the signal. The signal continues through a logic block labeled "2" and is routed through another buffer before reaching its final destination at Flip-Flop 2 (FF2), which is connected to `Dout3`. Buffers are strategically placed along this path to ensure that the signal remains strong and stable throughout its journey.</p>

consider ff-4:</p>
The path of `Din4` begins at the left side of the diagram and first passes through a yellow flip-flop labeled `FF1`. The signal then moves through a green buffer (`Buf`) before entering a green flip-flop, also labeled `FF1`. After that, it passes through a blue flip-flop labeled `FF2`. Finally, the signal exits the diagram as `Dout4` on the right side. This entire path is visually emphasized by being enclosed in a dotted oval in the bottom right section of the diagram.</p>

Congestion-aware placement using RePlAce involves:</p>

Global Placement: Initial rough positioning of cells with a focus on managing congestion.</p>
Detailed Placement: Fine-tuning of cell positions to optimize local routing and meet design constraints.</p>
RePlAce integrates both global and detailed placement stages, with an emphasis on managing and reducing congestion throughout the placement process.</p>

 The right side of the image shows the metal layers which are used in the fabrication of the circuit. These layers are responsible for connecting different parts of the circuit together. The overall flow of the process is shown by the arrows that connect the different stages of the process. The process is iterative, meaning that the designer may need to go back and make changes to the design at any stage.</p>
The design steps are:</p>
- Circuit design
